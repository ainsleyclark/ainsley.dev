draft: true
---


- Make the tree of your code as small as possible (horizontally), if you can return, return. You want to make it easily to follow on the eye, so you naturally go down the page.
- Minimize else statements.
- Small functions
- RETURN EARLY
- rule of 4 for function signatures
- Code should be boring
- Comments, public should always be commented
- Think about the end user
- Linting?
