We're thrilled to announce that [ainsley.dev](http://ainsley.dev) has earned another trophy to add to our digital
cabinet. The company has been honoured with
the [Website of the Year award](https://www.webguruawards.com/sites/ainsley-dev) from the
prestigious [Web Guru Awards](https://www.webguruawards.com/) for our brand new site, released in early 2022.

The Website of the Year award is known for recognising outstanding creativity and technical prowess in both web design
and development. The Web Guru Awards are a unique international platform that name the best designs on the web as part
of daily, monthly and annual competitions.

One of [ainsley.dev](http://ainsley.dev)'s key strengths is focusing on the finer details â€“ a philosophy which we bring
to each and every one of our bespoke client projects. When it came to designing and developing our own company website,
we didn't hold back. By applying the same ethos and after 8 months in the making, the result was a sleek, minimalistic
yet captivating website with unique animations that bring the site to life. Our bespoke scroll mockups used to showcase
our client stories create a personable feel and help the site to stand out from the crowd.

This latest accolade comes as a significant milestone in our digital journey, marking the company's first anniversary
within the web and software landscape. We are also proud to
see [our clients winning awards](https://ainsley.dev/insights/decspets-ecommerce-award/) for the bespoke platforms we
created for them, with these achievements helping
to [significantly increase their domain rating and web traffic](https://ainsley.dev/insights/web-design-awards/).

We hope you enjoy the site as much as we did making it.
