Written content has become such an important part of any digital marketing strategy that businesses need it more than
ever before. Not only has [Google’s quality control](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials) created a
need for websites to feature informative and well-written copy, but it also demands that it be regularly updated in its
various forms, including blogs, newsletters and social media updates. When creating copy for your website you might be
considering doing it in-house to save some money, but there are actually significant benefits of hiring a professional
copywriter to handle this for you which far outweigh any expense.

## Consistent branding

A professional copywriter can
help [maintain a consistent brand voice](https://marcom.com/build-trust-brand-consistency/) and tone across all of your
digital content. This is vital if you want your brand to be taken seriously, as it ensures your messaging is clear,
effective and professional. Since a copywriter has the expertise to write for different mediums and audiences, including
blog posts, product descriptions, landing pages, and social media posts, they can adapt their writing style to suit your
specific needs and make sure this is carried out consistently across all your business platforms.

## Higher search engine rankings

Your website is one of your most powerful assets as a business, as it enables you to reach a wide audience and tap into
markets well beyond your local reach. But first it needs to be found through a search engine. For this to happen, your
content needs to not only be high quality, but also be written
with [search engine optimisation](https://www.wordstream.com/seo) (SEO) factors in mind. A trained copywriter can write
quality, readable SEO-friendly content, which naturally includes keywords and links to help your website appear higher
in search results.

## Increased conversions

On the back of that, well-crafted, SEO-friendly content that speaks to your target audience can help increase traffic to
your website. Professional copywriters can write compelling copy that encourages visitors to your website to take the
desired action and ultimately lead to more sales.

## Regular fresh content

If you’re not regularly communicating with your current and potential clients, they are likely to forget you and look
elsewhere for their products and services. That's why it's so important to create fresh
content, [stay on top of trends](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-keep-up-latest-social-media-trends) and
offer seasonal promotions at certain times of year. A copywriter can expertly deliver unique content to keep your
audience engaged, and all you need to do is copy and paste.

## Decreased workload

Creating regular and consistent content can be a challenge for business owners, especially if your business is small. It
takes time to research, write, edit, as well as proofread content for errors before it is ready to post, especially if
it needs to be produced regularly. So, another benefit of hiring a professional copywriter is that they can brainstorm
ideas with you, and then go away and write a series of posts that you
can [schedule for weeks or even months in advance](https://later.com/blog/social-media-scheduler/). This will ease the
burden on you and free up your time to focus on other key aspects of your business.
