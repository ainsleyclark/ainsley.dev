We consciously refrain from using tracking, marketing, or any other commercial cookies. We call it our “No Cookie
Policy”. This no cookies policy explains what cookies are and how we avoid using them whenever we can. Some cookies are
part of a critical process, meaning they prevent fraudulent actions or enable the use of a form to get in touch with us.
These essential cookies are anonymous and cannot be used to identify you, nor can they be used for commercial
activities.

To be fully transparent, please see our official Cookie Policy below in which we explain what cookies are and how we
refrain from using them.

### Definition

Cookies are a small piece of data stored on the user’s computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies
were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the
shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user’s browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons,
logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember pieces of information
that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers.

### Our take

ainsley.dev LTD does not use or process any cookies. That means your form inputs won’t be seen when not submitted and
will be erased and forgotten when you refresh the page.

So when we say no cookies, we truly mean ‘no cookies’. Not even a single one.
