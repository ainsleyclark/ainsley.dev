								<h2>Discovery</h2>
								<p>At this stage, we kick off with a meeting to discover the project’s requirements and discover where you see yourself in the industry. We will discuss what you desire, what’s lacking in your current solution, and what you want to do to better it.</p>
								<p>Technical requirements will be established for the project, and a detailed proposal (if it’s a website) or SRS (software requirement specification) will be created detailing the design, templates and technical intricacies of the project.</p>
								<p>At the end of this stage, we can prepare a precise quotation for a better understanding of how much the project may cost and how long it will take.</p>

								<h2>Concept</h2>
								<p>This stage begins after a 50% deposit has been made. We give you some tasks to go away with and a questionnaire asking you for inspirational websites, colours, business goals and anything else relevant to the project.</p>
								<p>Finding out the specifics of what your brand requires will enable us to identify exactly what you represent and what you aim to achieve. Content will be either written by our in-house content writers or outsourced to a writer of your choice but is completed before design commences.</p>
								<p>A wireframe is typically made from the copy into basic page templates. This allows you to see the site layout in its final form and give constructive feedback where appropriate.</p>

								<h2>Design & architecture</h2>
								<p>Once we know your vision and how you want to see yourself in the market, we proceed to the design. The objective of the design phase is to create a fresh, coherent, user-friendly brand for your website. Potential design routes will be presented for you to choose from. Once you have provided feedback on these concepts, a custom design for the whole site will be created with a particular brand language using Adobe XD.</p>
								<p>This design will be published as a prototype, ready for easy commenting and adding any suggestions you see fit through a simple communication process.</p>

								<h2>Development</h2>
								<p>Commencing the development of the website or application, we will consider any existing website infrastructure. Ensuring that the brand migration process goes smoothly is essential to avoid the loss of organic traffic, so all of this is taken into consideration before we make the switch.</p>
								<p>A mobile-first development approach will be used to ensure the site is fully responsive across all viewports (mobile, tablet and desktop). SEO will be considered from the very beginning of the project, ensuring your site ranks highly. Factoring in high page speed, usability, accessibility and user experience will make the application easier for potential customers to discover and use and increase conversions.</p>

					{{< accordion/item title="How do you price a project?" >}}
						Upon receipt of your brief and our initial kick-off meeting, we will review everything and get back to you with a proposal and fixed cost. If you have a budget in mind, please let us know in advance.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="How long does it take to build an application?" >}}
						This entirely depends on your needs and the size of the project. A timeline is documented as part of a proposal.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you create APIs and marketing solutions?" >}}
						Yes. We are highly experienced in a vast array of backend technologies and can create custom software solutions to help you streamline any process.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you design bespoke logos?" >}}
						Yes. We can create sleek and professional full custom logo designs with mockups and a style guide for your business.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you create social media assets and style guides?" >}}
						Yes. We can create a wide variety of social media assets and guidelines that are on-trend for your new brand. You can see an example of brand guidelines on our <a href="/brand/">style guide pages</a>.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you provide e-commerce solutions?" >}}
						Yes. We can develop fully-bespoke WooCommerce themes and integrate any marketing tools you need to see the visibility of your new website blossom. All content can be edited in the backend of your website.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you create and write website content?" >}}
						Yes. We have a comprehensive content writer with years of experience writing copy for websites and landing pages, optimising for SEO and factoring in keyword research.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Can I edit the content of my new website?" >}}
						Dynamic websites using content management systems (CMSs) are in our highest service package, which gives you full control over every single word on your website. We primarily use <a href="https://github.com/verbiscms/verbis">Verbis</a>, an extremely swift platform built by ainsley.dev. However, we can use any platform you wish.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Can you set up domains and email?" >}}
						We can either transfer or buy a new domain name for your business. Setting up a custom domain email, such as hello@yourcompany.com, is a separate charge but is a guaranteed way of gaining more leads and having a professional social handle.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you offer ongoing support once our site is live?" >}}
						A service level agreement (SLA) can be implemented to ensure we continually monitor your new application and add any new features you see fit. This can entirely work around your budget. We charge £80 for an hour or £600 per day of design or development time.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Do you offer hosting?" >}}
						We can set up your website or application on an independent server, ensuring speed and reliability. This will be backed up daily for peace of mind.
					{{< /accordion/item >}}
					{{< accordion/item title="Who owns the project after it has been completed?" >}}
						The rights to the application and trademark as a whole belong to you. The codebase and design are intellectual property of ainsley.dev. Please see our <a href="/terms/">terms and conditions</a> for more information.
