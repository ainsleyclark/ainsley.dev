Thinkopedia is a non-profit mental health support platform, promoting methods for self-help and guidance for those
struggling to cope, and a way of sharing experiences through an online community platform, empowering people as they

<!-- Brief -->
{{< vertical-wrapper text="Brief" number="01" >}}
Thinkopedia wanted a minimalist, interactive, easy-to-use blogging platform. The main takeaway from the brief was the
desire to stand out from their competitors with a completely unique and captivating design. A striking contact form was
also needed, to enable people to get in touch easily.

<!-- Design -->
{{< vertical-wrapper text="Design" number="02" >}}
A minimalist design was sculpted from the initial brief, and an interesting layout was formulated from sketches. Whilst
the website still followed a conventional grid structure, imagery and type were slightly off-centre to keep the user
interested whilst reading the insightful blog posts. A bold sans-serif font was used and some headings were rotated to
capture the userâ€™s attention, which later aided the animation process.

<!-- Development -->
{{< vertical-wrapper text="Develop" number="03" >}}
Laravel was used as a back-end development framework to scrape blog posts from Medium and the content of the blog posts
was stored in a MySQL database. This meant all of the content was server side rendered, enabling Googlebot to scrape the
content easily. [barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) with GSAP was used to create smooth transitions between each page.
This gave the website an app-like quality, with small but effective UI transitions and micro animations.
