## Client

Katherine at Royal Beauty is a beauty salon specialising in massage and beauty treatments. They pride themselves on
creating a warm and friendly atmosphere, where clients can destress and go away feeling refreshed and revitalised.

## Brief

With no existing website, Katherine at Royal Beauty obtained all of their traffic
via [Treatwell](https://katherineroyalbeauty.mytreatwell.co.uk/). ainsley.dev were tasked with creating a brand-new,
comprehensive, one-page website with an easy, streamlined way for potential customers to get in touch to book massages
and treatments, whilst encapsulating the welcoming ambiance intrinsic to the salon.

## Design

Having a massage is a relaxing experience, so we wanted the new site to convey a sense of calm and tranquillity. A soft
colour palette consisting of blues and greens was used, with complementary iconography and gentle animated transitions.
We implemented booking and payment facilities utilising Treatwell as a tool, a familiar format to existing clientele
which allowed them to book with ease.

## Development

SVG circles were used throughout the landing page, which were animated using [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) (
animate on scroll), adding a depth of field to the design and keeping the user interested. Images were compressed and
lazy loaded, resulting in a page speed
of [96 on mobile](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkatherinebodycare.co.uk%2F). This really helped
grow their audience, as most of their organic traffic was coming from mobile devices.

## Results

- 96% PSI on mobile
- 135% over ROI
- 200% rise in social engagement
