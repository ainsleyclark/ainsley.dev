## Client

EDR Dental is a leading provider of dental restorations for clinicians and their patients across the U.K. They use
state-of-the-art milling machines to produce a wide variety of products from the very best materials.

## Brief

The existing website for EDR Dental was slow, cumbersome, and out of date. ainsley.dev was tasked to bring in a new,
refreshed brand for the company and introduce a simple UI to complement their bespoke dental restorations. A sleek and
fluid design was needed to bring the company into the modern era, with easy ways to get in touch.

## Design

To reinforce a clean, modernised dental laboratory feel, a deep blue with soft pastel greens were used, which invoked
trust in the brand. Clear, detailed iconography was embedded in the designs which, coupled with a dot pattern scattered
throughout the design, added a depth of field. A simple layout with a conventional grid structure made the user flow
easy to navigate.

## Development

[Verbis CMS](https://github.com/verbiscms/verbis) was used as a content management system, allowing EDR Dental to change
each and every word on their new, modernised site. This made for an extremely rapid platform,
achieving [97 PSI on mobile](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fedrdental.co.uk%2F); married with high
attention to detail for accessibility and SEO factors, web.dev/measure lighthouse scores were impressively
high. [barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) was used in tandem with [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) to achieve
clean, professional page transitions which gave the website an app-like quality.

## Results

- 2.7k impressions
- 97 point PSI on desktop
- 8% average CTR
