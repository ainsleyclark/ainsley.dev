## Brief
Scott's Guttering wanted to bring a fresh, high-quality approach to the new website and attract as many potential
customers as possible.

ainsley.dev was approached to design and develop an industry-leading guttering website in the south-east of England.
The goal of the new landing page was to increase traffic in Kent and surrounding areas to use Scott's Guttering for their
services. Clear and concise information needed to be displayed throughout the landing page, with clear call to actions
and a streamlined UI/UX.

## Design
A bright orange/red and dark navy color palette was chosen in order to capture the user's attention as soon as they land
on the page. Gradients of these colours create a depth of field on buttons and imagery, whilst maintaining a simple layout
throughout. Reviews were added in the hero section to facilitate trust in the brand, complemented by the iconography,
shadows and cards, and CTAs were designed as an easy way for customers to get in touch.

## Development
A flat, static site was developed using HTML, a custom CSS framework [meshCSS](https://meshcss.com) and minimal
JavaScript. Micro animations were crafted on the buttons and iconography using pure CSS, making sleek transitions between
the interface states and improving the UX of the site. A page speed of 93 on mobile and 100 on desktop were achieved by
lazy loading, minification and image optimisation, which made for an extremely rapid landing page.
