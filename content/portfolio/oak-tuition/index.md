ainsley.dev were approached to replace an off-the-peg website with a professional, but playful multi-page online
presence, together with a clear branding across their site and social media pages. The website needed to feature enough key
information to increase traffic and entice prospective clients to make contact.

<!-- Design -->
{{< vertical-section text="Design" number="02" >}}
Soft pastel colours were utilised throughout the site to invoke a sense of childhood and play. These were contrasted
with a clear black font for headings, buttons, forms, and calls to action. In order to lighten the tone, the original
oak tree logo was completely redesigned to include these pastel colours, and made to incorporate an illustration of a
student sitting on a swing on one of the tree branches.

<!-- Development -->
{{< vertical-section text="Develop" number="03" >}}
WordPress was used for the development of the site, including [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) (Advanced
Custom Fields), enabling Oak Tuition to freely change and edit the content of their new
site. [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) was used to create a wide variety of animations for the homepage, including
layer masks, so that the tree appeared to grow out of the ground, and a girl swinging on the branch, which made the site
more playful and interactive.
