### Logo

This is the ainsley.dev logo. It is our primary graphic device and should be the first choice when choosing a graphic
element to represent the ainsley.dev brand. Please do not edit, change, distort, recolour or reconfigure the
logo.

### Colours

Our logo should always be all black, all white, or white symbol with black word mark and vice versa. It never takes on
any additional colours, and cannot be placed on top of any colour within the ainsley.dev brand palette.
