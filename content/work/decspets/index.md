## Intro

## Client
Dec's Pets is an online e-commerce marketplace which started operating in 2018. They are a family run business
specialising in pet retailing catering for all manners of pet care. They provide a wide variety of services to their
main clientele based in Ireland but wanted to reach a worldwide audience.

### Technologies

## Brief
Their existing website was created using Flatsome, an off the shelf WordPress theme that was very limiting in terms of
UI & UX and there was no design language or consistent branding. Our brief was to modernise the website, whilst still
maintain a fun and family friendly design, so it's relatable to people who want to buy pet products with ease. A large
number of WordPress plugins were being used on the original site, which was detrimental to PSI, our goal was to
consolidate these plugins to make an all-in-one solution for their marketing needs.

Dec's Pets existing checkout process was fairly streamline, with Stripe, PayPal and one click checkout, our aim was to ensure
that this functionality was still there, but with more of a stylised approach, making it easy for the customer to
navigate.More visibility was needed for Dec's Pets brand and presence in the E-commerce market, enabling them to have a
wider  variety of customers generating a diverse market and appealing to a wider audience.

## Design & Development OR Strategy?

## Design
We TODO STEPH formulated a strategy in which the design of the site would help reinforce the brand that Dec's Pets were
trying to achieve. A light blue and striking pink colour scheme was creating to invoke trust but still a modern play on
the Pet marketplace. A friendly heading type was used to make the design more interactive with a sans-serif font used
for the body to create clean, crisp and readable content. Different emojis were added to add a fun aspect and the Dec's
Pets "Paw" illustration was used was a watermark in certain pages to create a consitent brand language.
