## Brief
Oak Tuition's previous website was a static build created using GoDaddy. They approached ainsley.dev to design and build
a website which would translate the excellent tutoring experience into a playful, yet easy to navigate digital
A clean, professional look was needed to create a fresh new brand across their website and social media channels but
still conveying the lighthearted nature of needed to make it appealing for children's education.

The website needed to feature core services, an about section and a team page but fundamentally increase traffic to the
site and get potential clientele to get in touch for their excellent tutoring and teaching services.

## Design
Soft pastel colours were used throughout the site to invoke a sense of play, childhood and growth which complimented
their core services and brand language they were trying to achieve. A solid black colour was used to compliment these
pastel colours which worked well in contrast for headings, buttons, forms, and call to actions. The Oak tree was
redesigned to include these pastel colours and more light-hearted with a student swinging from one of the tree branches
appearing as if she is studying.

## Development
WordPress was used for the development of the site including [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) (Advanced
Custom Fields) enabling Oak Tuition to freely change and edit the content of their new site. [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
Plugins were kept to a bare minimum and tips were used to increase PSI and LCP (largest contentful paint).

was used to create a wide variety of animations for the homepage. Layer masks were used with the hero illustration so
that it would appear tha the tree to grow out of the ground. A loop was then used to animate the girl swinging from the
branch. This a great deal interaction to the site, added with combination of scroll animations, it made for a fun and
friendly website. TODO Steph, does this last bit need to be changed>

## Results
- 92% increase in traffic
- Over 200 conversions
