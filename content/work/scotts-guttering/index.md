## Brief
ainsley.dev was approached to design and develop an industry-leading guttering website in the south-east of England.
The goal of the new landing page was to increase traffic in Kent nad surrounding areas to use Scott's Guttering for their
services. Clear and concise information was to be displayed throughout the landing page with clear call to actions and
a streamlined UI/UX.
Scott's Guttering wanted to bring a fresh approach to guttering services with their high quality style throughout the
new website and attract as many potential customers as possible.

## Design
A bright orange and navy blue color palette was used to capture the user's attention as soon as they landed. Reviews
were added in the hero section to facilitate trust in their new brand. Orange and blue gradients were used to create a
depth of field on buttons and imagery with a simple layout throughout. CTAs were designed to facilitate an
extremely easy way for customers to get in touch with Scott at every opportunity, this was complimented by the
iconography, shadows and cards.
