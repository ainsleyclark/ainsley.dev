## Brief
The goals of the new website would be for all of Kent and surrounding areas to use my company for anything gutter related,
for my company website to reinforce the fact that Scott’s Guttering is the best in the business.

Clear and concise information for their services was to be shown with informa
Fascia, soffit and conservatory washes, pictures of washes and gutter clearances.

They wanted to have a constant stream of enquiries and more people to book jobs on a regular basis. This was to be
achieved with a streamline way for potential customers to get in touch.

				Maybe pictures of work being carried out by employees.
