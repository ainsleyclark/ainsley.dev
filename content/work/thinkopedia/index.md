## Brief
Thinkopedia wanted to create a minimalist, easy to use and interactive blogging platform. Posts on the new website were
to be automatically obtained and linked from [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) when a new article was created. Three
category pages were to be designed each with a unique style and imagery. A striking contact form was also to created
so people can get in touch with Cody easily.

The main takeaway from the brief is that Thinkopedia wanted stand out from the crowd, and have a completely unique and
captivating design.

## Design
A minimalist design was sculpted from Cody's ideas, and an interesting layout was formulated from his sketches. Whilst
the website still followed a conventional grid structure, imagery and type was slightly off center to keep the user
captivated as they continued to read Cody's insightful blog posts. A bold sans-serif font (Inter) was used in the
designs to capture the users' attention on each of the pages. Some headings were rotated 90 degrees to add interest to
the designs which later help to aid the animation process.

## Development
Laravel was used as back-end development framework to scrape blog posts from Medium which was set up as a cron job to
run every midnight. The content of the blog posts were stored in a MySQL database, which meant all content was server
side rendered, enabling Googlebot to scrape the content easily.
[Barba.js](https://barba.js.org/), was used to create fluid and smooth transitions between each page. This gave the
website an app like quality with small but effective UI transitions and micro animations. No JavaScript fallbacks were
added where possible to adhere to progressive enhancement.
