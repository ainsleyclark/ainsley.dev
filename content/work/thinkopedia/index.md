## Brief
Thinkopedia wanted a minimalist, easy to use and interactive blogging platform. Posts on the new website would be
automatically obtained and linked from [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) when a new article was created. Three
category pages were to be designed, each with a unique style and imagery. A striking contact form was also needed, to
enable people to get in touch with Cody easily.

The main takeaway from the brief was that Thinkopedia wanted stand out from the crowd, and have a completely unique and
captivating design.

## Design
A minimalist design was sculpted from Cody's ideas, and an interesting layout was formulated from his sketches. Whilst
the website still followed a conventional grid structure, imagery and type were slightly off-centre to keep the user
interested whilst reading Cody's insightful blog posts. A bold sans-serif font (Inter) was used in the designs to
capture the user's attention on each of the pages. Some headings were rotated 90 degrees to add interest to the designs,
which later help to aid the animation process.

## Development
Laravel was used as a back-end development framework to scrape blog posts from Medium, which was set up as a cron job to
run every midnight. The content of the blog posts was stored in a MySQL database, which meant all content was server
side rendered, enabling Googlebot to scrape the content easily.
[Barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) was used to create smooth transitions between each page. This gave the
website an app-like quality, with small but effective UI transitions and micro animations. Where possible, no JavaScript
fallbacks were added to adhere to progressive enhancement.
