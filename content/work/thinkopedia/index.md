## Brief
Thinkopedia wanted to create a minimalist, easy to use and interactive blogging platform. Posts on the new website were
to be automatically obtained and linked from [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) when a new article was created. Three
category pages were to be designed each with a unique style and imagery. A striking contact form was also to created
so people can get in touch with Cody easily.

The main takeaway from the brief is that Thinkopedia wanted stand out from the crowd, and have a completely unique and
captivating design.

## Design
A minimalist design was sculpted from Cody's ideas, and in interesting layout was formulated from his sketches. Whilst
the website still followed a conventional grid structure, imagery and type was slightly off center to keep the user
captivated as they continued to read Cody's insightful blog posts.
