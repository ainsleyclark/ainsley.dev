## Brief
With no existing website, Katherine at Royal Beauty obtained all of their traffic via [Treatwell](https://katherineroyalbeauty.mytreatwell.co.uk/).
Consequently, ainsley.dev was tasked to design and build a one-page website to attract more clients to the salon and
display details about their massage and treatment services. An easy, streamlined way for potential customers to get in
touch to book massages and treatments was required.

Throughout the brand exploration process, we had to make sure the website was not only easy to digest but also reflected
the character and personality behind Katherine at Royal Beauty with emphasis on fantastic beauty treatments.

## Design
It goes without saying that having a massage is a relaxing experience, so we wanted to convey a sense of relaxation and
tranquility in a soft UI and design. A serif font (Playfair Display) was used for the headings and titles to represent
tradition and relaxation, whilst a sans-serif type (Open Sans) was used for the body copy to make the cards and other
stand out UI elements easy to read. A soft colour palette consisting of blues, greens and turquoise helped to reinforce
a relaxing design. Iconography also used the same palette which added to the tranquil nature of the site.

## Development
A static site was developed using a custom CSS framework [meshCSS](https://meshcss.com). SVG circles were used
throughout the landing page which were animated in using [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) which added a depth of
field to the design and kept the user interested.
Images were compressed and lazy loaded resulting in a page speed of [96 on mobile](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkatherinebodycare.co.uk%2F),
this really helped their audience to grow as most of their organic traffic were coming from mobile devices.
