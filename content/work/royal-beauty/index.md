## Brief
Katherine didn't have an existing website, and obtained all of their traffic via [Treatwell](https://katherineroyalbeauty.mytreatwell.co.uk/).
Due to this, they approached ainsley.dev TODO (Steph to change they approached, its repetitive.) to design and build a
one-page website to attract more visitors to the salon and display useful information about their massage and treatment services.

They wanted to include an easy, streamlined way for potential customers to get in contact to book massages and
treatments.

Steph: TODO, need to expand a bit

## Design
It goes without saying that having a massage is a relaxing experience, so we wanted to convey a sense of relaxation and
tranquility in a soft UI and design. A serif font (Playfair Display) was used for the headings and titles to represent
tradition and relaxation, whilst a sans-serif type (Open Sans) was used for the body copy to make the cards and other
stand out UI elements easy to read. A soft colour palette consisting of blues, greens and turquoise helped to reinforce
a relaxing design. Iconography also used the same palette which added to the tranquil nature of the site.

## Development
A static site was developed using a custom CSS framework [meshCSS](https://meshcss.com). SVG circles were used
throughout the landing page which were animated in using [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) which added a depth of
field to the design and kept the user interested.
Images were compressed and lazy loaded resulting in a page speed of [96 on mobile](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkatherinebodycare.co.uk%2F),
this really helped their audience to grow as most of their organic traffic were coming from mobile devices.
