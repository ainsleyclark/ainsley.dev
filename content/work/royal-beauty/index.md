## Brief
Katherine at Royal Beauty, didn't have an existing website, and obtained all of their traffic via [Treatwell](https://katherineroyalbeauty.mytreatwell.co.uk/).
They approached ainsley.dev to design and build a one-page website to attract more visitors to the salon and display
useful information about their massage and treatment services.


## Design
It goes without saying that having a massage is a relaxing experience, so we wanted to convey a sense of relaxation and
tranquility in a soft UI and design.
