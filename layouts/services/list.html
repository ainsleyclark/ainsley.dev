									<p>At this stage, we kick off with a meeting to discover the project’s requirements and where you see yourself in the industry. We discuss what you desire, what’s lacking in your current solution, and how we can better it.</p>
									<p>Technical requirements are established for the project, and a detailed proposal (if it’s a website) or SRS (software requirement specification) is created detailing the design, templates and technical intricacies of the project.</p>
									<p>At the end of this stage, we can prepare a precise quotation for a better understanding of how much the project may cost and how long it will take.</p>

									<p>This stage begins after a 50% deposit has been made. We give you some tasks to go away with and a questionnaire asking you for inspirational websites, colours, business goals and anything else relevant to the project.</p>
									<p>Finding out the specifics of what your brand requires enables us to identify exactly what you represent and what you aim to achieve. Content is either written by our in-house content writers or outsourced to a writer of your choice, but is always completed before design commences.</p>
									<p>A wireframe is typically made from the copy into basic page templates. This allows you to see the site layout in its final form and give constructive feedback where appropriate.</p>

									<p>Once we know your vision and how you want to see yourself in the market, we proceed to the design. The objective of the design phase is to create a fresh, coherent, user-friendly brand for your website. Potential design routes are presented for you to choose from. Once you have provided feedback on these concepts, a custom design for the whole site are created with a particular brand language using Adobe XD.</p>
									<p>This design is then published as a prototype, ready for easy commenting and adding any suggestions you see fit through a simple communication process.</p>

									<p>Commencing the development of the website or application, we consider any existing website infrastructure. Ensuring that the brand migration process goes smoothly is essential to avoid the loss of organic traffic, so all of this is taken into consideration before we make the switch.</p>
									<p>A mobile-first development approach is used to ensure the site is fully responsive across all viewports (mobile, tablet and desktop). SEO is considered from the very beginning of the project, ensuring your site ranks highly. Factoring in high page speed, usability, accessibility and user experience will make the application easier for potential customers to discover and use and increase conversions.</p>
