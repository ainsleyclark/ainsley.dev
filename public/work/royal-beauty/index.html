<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>
<p>With no existing website, Katherine at Royal Beauty obtained all of their traffic via <a href="https://katherineroyalbeauty.mytreatwell.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treatwell</a>
.
Consequently, ainsley.dev was tasked to design and build a one-page website to attract more clients to the salon and
display details about their massage and treatment services. An easy, streamlined way for potential customers to get in
touch to book massages and treatments was required.</p>
<p>Throughout the brand exploration process, we had to make sure the website was not only easy to digest but also reflected
the character behind Katherine at Royal Beauty with an emphasis on high quality beauty treatments.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that having a massage is a relaxing experience, so we wanted to convey a sense of calm and
tranquility in a soft UI and design. A serif font (Playfair Display) was used for the headings and titles to represent
relaxation, whilst a sans-serif type (Open Sans) for the body copy makes the cards and other UI elements easy to read.
A soft colour palette consisting of blue, green and turquoise helped to reinforce the relaxing design. The same hues
were used for iconography, which added to the tranquil nature of the site.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>A flat, static site was developed using HTML, a custom CSS framework <a href="https://meshcss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meshCSS</a>
 and minimal
JavaScript. SVG circles were used throughout the landing page, which were animated using <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AOS</a>
,
adding a depth of field to the design and keeping the user interested. Images were compressed and lazy loaded resulting
in a page speed of <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkatherinebodycare.co.uk%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96 on mobile</a>
.
This really helped grow their audience, as most of their organic traffic was coming from mobile devices.</p>
