<p>Dec&rsquo;s Pets is an online e-commerce marketplace which started operating in 2018. They are a family run business
specialising in pet retail, catering for all manners of pet care. They provide a large variety of services to their
main clientele, based in Ireland, but wanted to reach a wider audience.</p>
<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>
<p>ainsley.dev was tasked to modernise the website using a fun and family friendly design, and to make
the site more user-friendly for buying products with ease. Dec&rsquo;s Pets existing website was created using Flatsome, an
off the shelf WordPress theme that was very limited in terms of UI &amp; UX and lacked design language or consistent
branding.</p>
<p>The existing checkout process for Dec&rsquo;s Pets was fairly streamline, using Stripe, PayPal and one-click checkout. Our aim
was to ensure that this functionality was still prevalent, but with a more stylised approach. More visibility was needed
for the company&rsquo;s brand and presence in the E-commerce market, enabling them to have a wider variety of customers
generating a diverse market and driving ROI.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>A design strategy was formulated to reinforce the brand that Dec&rsquo;s Pets were trying to achieve. A light blue and
striking pink colour scheme was created to invoke trust, but still reflect the playfulness of the pet marketplace. A
friendly heading type was used to make the design more interactive, with the body in sans-serif font to create
clean, crisp and readable content. Different emojis were added to give the site a fun feel and the Dec&rsquo;s
Pets &ldquo;Paw&rdquo; illustration was created as a watermark on certain pages to create a consistent brand language.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Using WooCommerce with WordPress, fully custom page templates were created for the new website. Minimal front-end
libraries were used in order to increase page load time. Back-end services were rewritten in PHP, removing the use of
any heavy plugins such as MailChimp and Stamped.IO. Custom curl requests were used in order to interact with various
APIs. This cut down on bloat of the website, whilst still maintaining crucial marketing functionality.</p>
<p>It was clear that the original site imagery was not being optimised or compressed, thus increasing LCP (largest
contentful paint) times, and whilst many image optimisation plugins exist in the WordPress plugins library, none took
advantage of the new image format <code>avif</code>. So a new plugin was created, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/squidge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squidge</a>
,
which used in conjunction with lazy loading images, made for an extremely quick platform.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>60% growth in overall traffic.</li>
<li>40 point increase in PSI.</li>
<li>X increase in ROI.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testimonial">Testimonial</h2>
<p>Ainsley is one of the most competent developers I have ever met. I have had the pleasure of working closely with him on
the development of my new website. He has such a huge array of skills not just in web development but across business
and eCommerce as a whole that not only did he help us create a beautiful and modern website he also helped us with ideas
and initiatives for the future. It was a pleasure working with him.</p>
