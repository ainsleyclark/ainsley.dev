<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>
<p>Oak Tuition&rsquo;s previous website was a static build, created using GoDaddy. They approached ainsley.dev to design and
build a website which would translate the excellent tutoring experience into a playful yet easy to navigate digital
experience. A clean, professional look was needed to create a fresh new brand across their website and social media
channels, whilst still conveying the lighthearted nature necessary to make it appealing for children&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p>The website needed to feature core services, an about section and a team page but fundamentally increase traffic to the
site and entice potential clients to get in touch for their excellent tutoring and teaching services.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Soft pastel colours were used throughout the site to invoke a sense of play, childhood and growth which complimented
their core services and the brand language they were trying to achieve. A solid black colour was used to contrast these
pastel colours, which worked well for headings, buttons, forms, and call to actions. The oak tree logo was redesigned to
include these pastel colours and given a light-hearted feel by incorporating an animation of a student sitting on a
swing on one of the tree branches.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>WordPress was used for the development of the site including <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACF</a>
 (Advanced
Custom Fields) enabling Oak Tuition to freely change and edit the content of their new site. Plugins were kept to a bare
minimum and tricks were used to increase PSI (page speed) and decrease LCP (largest contentful paint).</p>
<p><a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSAP</a>
 was used to create a wide variety of animations for the homepage. The hero
illustration included layer masks so that the tree appeared to grow out of the ground, and a loop was then used to
animate the girl on the swing. These aspects, together with a combination of scroll animations, make the site more
playful and interactive, as indicated in the brief.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>92% increase in traffic</li>
<li>Over 200 conversions</li>
<li>56 increase in PSI</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testimonial">Testimonial</h2>
<p>Ainsley is fantastic. Makes the whole process of web development so easy through his support and expertise. Highly
recommend and would definitely work with Ainsley again.</p>
