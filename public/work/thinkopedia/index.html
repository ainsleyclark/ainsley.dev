<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>
<p>Thinkopedia wanted a minimalist, easy to use and interactive blogging platform. Posts on the new website would be
automatically obtained and linked from <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium.com</a>
 when a new article was created. Three
category pages were to be designed, each with a unique style and imagery. A striking contact form was also needed, to
enable people to get in touch with Cody easily.</p>
<p>The main takeaway from the brief was that Thinkopedia wanted stand out from the crowd, and have a completely unique and
captivating design.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>A minimalist design was sculpted from Cody&rsquo;s ideas, and an interesting layout was formulated from his sketches. Whilst
the website still followed a conventional grid structure, imagery and type were slightly off-centre to keep the user
interested whilst reading Cody&rsquo;s insightful blog posts. A bold sans-serif font (Inter) was used in the designs to
capture the user&rsquo;s attention on each of the pages. Some headings were rotated 90 degrees to add interest to the designs,
which later help to aid the animation process.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Laravel was used as a back-end development framework to scrape blog posts from Medium, which was set up as a cron job to
run every midnight. The content of the blog posts was stored in a MySQL database, which meant all content was server
side rendered, enabling Googlebot to scrape the content easily.
<a href="https://barba.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barba.js</a>
 was used to create smooth transitions between each page. This gave the
website an app-like quality, with small but effective UI transitions and micro animations. Where possible, no JavaScript
fallbacks were added to adhere to progressive enhancement.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of impressions</li>
<li>TODO</li>

<h2 id="testimonial">Testimonial</h2>
<p>This was my first experience creating a website, and Ainsley really helped me every step of the way. The level of detail
he delivered on was incredible. The end result was 10 times better than I could have ever imagined. Highly recommend,
will be in contact again! Thanks, Ainsley.</p>
